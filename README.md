Quick Start
===========


``` html
$ git clone git://github.com/sergeylukin/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ source install.sh
```

Installation script installs only dotfiles for the components that are installed on
your system. Here is the full list of components:

* ZSH
* OH-MY-ZSH
* VIM
* GIT
* ROXTERM
* Xfce Terminal Emulator
* SCREEN
* TMUX

Screenshots
===========

Below are some screenshots of how your environment should look after setting up the dotfiles. I made these screenshots while working via PUTTY remotely, but when working locally, ROXTERM looks exactly the same.
