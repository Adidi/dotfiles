Quick Start
===========

I recommend that you install ZSH, OH-MY-ZSH, VIM and ROXTERM on your unix machine before continue.

``` html
$ git clone git://github.com/sergeylukin/dotfiles.git ~/bin/dotfiles
$ cd ~/bin/dotfiles
$ source install.sh
```

Note that if you had ~/.gitconfig present, you would need to change your GIT credentials:

``` html
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "your@email"
```

You're done.

Screenshots
===========

Below are some screenshots of how your environment should look after setting up the dotfiles. I made these screenshots while working via PUTTY remotely, but when working locally, ROXTERM looks exactly the same.
